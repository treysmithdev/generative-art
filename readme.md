# generative-art

### Description

I've been wanting to get into generative art for a while now. As a musician working full time in the data analytics industry, I've always thought that this would be a good way to combine both logic and creativity. I may dabble in programmatically creating music as well, but for now I am focused on visuals alone. 

At the moment I've been really diggin vaporwave art, so I've been tapping the inner cyberpunk in me. However, I don't expect this to be the only type of things I make.

### Getting Started

My platform of choice is [PyProcessing](https://py.processing.org/). It's basically an IDE that you can write python in and execute it to *draw* visuals. If you want to generate this yourself, install the IDE and clone the repo.
